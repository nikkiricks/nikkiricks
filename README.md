# Oh heeeyyyyyyyy there

Hi! Welcome! I'm Nikki. I started coding in 2019, went to General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive and now am an Apprentice Developer at Envato in Melbourne Australia.

## Current Project

I'm currently working on an [anti-racism site](https://github.com/nikkiricks/anti-racism-work) where I track my learning, resources, actions, and donations. This work is really important to me as an intersectional feminist. Eventually I want to create a MERN app but as of July 2020 I've been adding my daily work in HTML.

## Past Projects

Some of my favorite projects I've working on was with hardware. You can see my [intro repo to NodeBots](https://github.com/nikkiricks/Node_Bots) and a ["phone" with NodeBots](https://github.com/nikkiricks/Sloane-Phone-Node) and this is a [repo](https://github.com/nikkiricks/Sloane-Phone-Arduino) I created using Arduino IDE.
